## Licensing

As BabbleSim is formed of multiple, independent, and mostly optional
components, different licenses may apply to different components.
Overall, and unless otherwise stated, BabbleSim components use the
[Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)
(as found in the LICENSE file in each component GitHub repo), both for
their source code and documentation.

### Components using other Licenses

There are some components in BabbleSim which use different
licenses than the Apache 2.0. In the component in which it is applicable,
it will be described in its LICENSE file, which is placed in that component
`docs/` folder.

## Developer Certification of Origin (DCO)

The BabbleSim project requires the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
process to be followed for its contributions.

This is done as a resonable measure to ensure all code in BabbleSim components
can be licensed under the claimed terms.

By adding a ``Signed-off-by`` line to the commit body message like:
```
   Signed-off-by: John Doe <JohnDoe@somedomain.com>
```
the contributor certifies that he has the right to, and does submit
that patch, under the applicable license, and, that he agrees to the DCO.

The DCO agreement can be found in http://developercertificate.org/, and is
shown below:
