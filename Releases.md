## BabbleSim releases

BabbleSim's components master branches are tested,
and kept so that all non-deprecated components master branches tips can be used with each other.

Still, for CI, for those who require higher stability, and for those who desire to stay in a given working combination of components,
releases are provided.
These are provided as branches on the manifest repositories:

* [Repo manifest releases](https://github.com/BabbleSim/manifest/branches)
* [West manifest releases](https://github.com/BabbleSim/bsim_west/branches)

Note that these repositories also include manifests intended for developers which purposedly track components' master branches.
If you are interested in a release be sure to only use manifests which point to specific tags or sha.
